These R scripts replicate the simulations and analyses reported in the manuscript "A Note on the Use of Rank Ordered Logit Models for Ordered Response Categories" published in the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology.

Note that some scripts create data that are read by other scripts. 

Note that some additional packages will need to be installed.
