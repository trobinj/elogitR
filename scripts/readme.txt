These R scripts replicate the simulations and analyses reported in the manuscript "A Note on the Use of Rank Ordered Logit Models for Ordered Response Categories" published in the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology.

Note that some scripts create data that are read by other scripts. To run these scripts yourself you will need to change the working directory specified in each script.
